# Managing data in the cloud

## Creating data for the cloud 

### Cloud secure datalife cycle 
1. Create
2. Store
3. Use 
4. Share 
5. Archive 
6. Destroy

### Buisness process function
- Access
- Process
- Store

### Data discovery 
Goal: find information from data 
Process: asking questions in the data to see the visual results and refining these questions

## Storing data in the cloud 

### Storage types 

IAAS (infrastructure as a service) :
- **Ephemeral storage** : instance works with virtual machines
- **Volume/block**: storage is centralized and integrated as an OS managed local hard drive
- **object/Blob**: data is provided as large files and made available in file system like schema
- **Raw storage**: Raw device mapping
- **Long term storage**: data archiving  

PAAS(platform as a service):
- **Relational database**: structured database
- **strong text**: semi-structured and unstructured
- **Map reduce**: algorithm to divide dataset to smaller ones

SAAS(software as a service):
- **Information storage and managment**: for web interface and content file storage.
- **Content deleviry network(CDN)**:data distruibted to multiple geographically disrbuited nodes.

### Storage threats 
- Unauthorized usage
- Liablity due to regulatory noncompliance
- Denial of service(DOS) and distrubted denial of services(DDOS) attack on storage
- Data leaks and breaches
- Theft of accedental loss of media
- Malware attack or introduction
- improper treatment or santization after end of use

### Treacherous twelve
1. Data breaches 
2. Weak credintals and access managment
3. insecure API
4. system vulnerabilites 
5. Account hijacking
6. Malicous insider 
7. advanced presistent Threats (apt)
8. Data loss
9. insuffecient due diligance 
10. Abuse and Nefarious use of cloud services
11. denial of service 
12. Shared tecnology issues
---
### Storage protection 
- **Encryption**: Data in motion (DIM), Data at rest(DAR),Data in use(DIU)
- **Encryption components**:
1. Data 
2. Encryption engine 
3. Encryption keys 
- **IAAS encryption**:
1. Basic storage level encryption 
2. volume storage encryption: instance based encryption, proxy based encryption.
3. object storage encryption: file-level encryption, application-level encryption
- **PAAS encryption**:
1. file- level encryption
2. transparent encryption
- **SAAS encryption**:
1. Application-level encryption
---
### key managment 
1. Acess to the keys
2. key storage
3. backup and replication
4. internally managment
5. externally managment
6. managed by third party
---
### Emerging storage tecnology 
- **Bit splitting**: split encrypted data to smaller units and store them in different storages
- **Homomorphic encryption**:enable processing data without the need of decrypting it
- **Quantim computing**:uses quantim mechanics

## Protecting sensitive information in the cloud 

### Cloud data security 
- **Confedintiality**: information only available to authorized indivduals
- **Integrity**: unauthorized changes is prevented
- **availability**:ensure that system is up and running

These three is refeered as informaion security traid

---
### Data managment roles
- **Data subject**:subject of personal data,can be identified directly or indirectly
- **Data controller**:Determines the puprose of any personal data is being proccessed
- **Data processor**: any process who process data behalf of data controller 
- **Data steward**: responsible for data content,context and associated business rules
- **Data custodians**: safety, transport,storage of data and implentation of business rules
- **Data owner**: got complete control over data elements
- ---
### Personal identitibiable information (PII):
- **P and Dp laws**: to provide protection to individual data processing 
- **cloud service consumers**
- **cloud service provider**: able to demonstarte the rules and security measures to be applied on processing of personal data
